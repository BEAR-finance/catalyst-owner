# Catalyst Management

Welcome to the Catalyst management tool!

Here you will find everything you need to set up you our Catalyst node.

## Set up

### Requirements

* You will need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed.
* You will to have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
* The initialization script runs on Bash. It has not been tested on Windows.

In order to run a public server, you will also need to:
* Have a public domain pointing to your server.
* Your server will need to have the HTTPS port open (443).

### What you will need to configure
To configure your node, you will have to set three variables in the [.env](.env) file:

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:-----:|:-----:|
| EMAIL | Needed to handle the TLS certificates. For example, you will be notified when they are about to expire. | - | yes |
| CONTENT_SERVER_STORAGE |The path to the directory where the content will be stored. | - | yes |
| CATALYST_URL |The public domain of the node. For example `https://peer.decentraland.org`. It is really important that you add `https://` at the beginning of the URL. If you are running your node locally, then simply write `http://localhost` | - | yes |

There is also some advanced configuration in the [.env-advanced](.env-advanced) file. Normally, it shouldn't be modified.

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:-----:|:-----:|
| ETH_NETWORK | Which Ethereum network you want to use. Usually is `ropsten` for testing or `mainnet` for production | mainnet | yes |
| REGENERATE | This will instruct the script to regenerate the certs. `0` will keep the certificates, `1` will ask for certificate renewal. If there are no certificates, the initialization script will generate them automatically, regardless of this value. For more information, look at FAQ questions (2), (3) and (4)| 0 | yes |




## Running your Catalyst

After you have configured everything, all you need to do is run:

```
./init.sh
```

#### How to make sure that your Catalyst is running

Once you started your Catalyst server, after a few seconds you should be able to test the different services by accessing:

* Content: `CATALYST_URL/content/status`
* Comms: `CATALYST_URL/comms/status`
* Lambdas: `CATALYST_URL/lambdas/status`


## Updating your Catalyst

To update your Catalyst to a newer version, you can do the same as above:

```
./init.sh
```

## Stopping your Catalyst node

To stop a specific container on your node:

```
./stop.sh
```

## Stopping a specific container from a Catalyst node
To stop a specific container on your node:

```
./stop.sh [ nginx | lambdas | content-server | comms-server ]
```

## FAQ
### 1. How are TLS certificates managed?
We are using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for certificates. We automatically generate the certificates the first time you start your server. We will also handle the renewal of the server for you!

### 2. When issuing a certificate, if fails the first time, the script won't try to issue a new one.
One of the steps in issuing a certificate is the creation of auto signed certs. The script checks if there are any certs already created. If they exist, then no new certificates are created.

To force a certificate regeneration you will need to change the `REGENERATE` entry on the `.env` file to `1` and then execute the script again.

**IT'S IMPORTANT** to roll back this value to `0`. If you don't, a new certificate will be issued on each run and you will hit the Let's Encrypt ratio limit. It this happens, your domain will be banned.

### 3. How many certs I can issue?
This is tied to Let's Encrypt ratio limit. To know about Let's Encrypt ratio limit look [here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/)

### 4. How can I can check the amount of certificates I already issued?
You can take a look on this [site](https://crt.sh/), entering the domain you want to check.

## Compression

By default, the nginx of Catalyst is configured to compress requests greater than 30kb. This compression can be CPU intensive, but it is necessary to ensure load times are as small as possible.

But if clients won't be requesting directly to the Catalyst, it could be convenient to turn the compression off to reduce CPU usage (for instance, if you put the Catalyst behind Cloudflare or other CDN).

To turn off compression, simply edit the configuration in [local/nginx/nginx.conf](local/nginx/nginx.conf) and comment/delete the following lines:

```
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript application/octet-stream;
    gzip_min_length 30000;
```
